# Professional Track 4
## Final Requirement

### General Objective

Apply a Deep Learning Algorithm on TensorFlow using Keras API in a real-world project.

### Specific Objectives

1. To utilize Python, TensorFlow, Keras API and other Machine Learning libraries in developing a deep learning application.
2. To create a Google Colab notebook that integrates the application’s live code with `Anvil.works`.
3. To develop a simple web app (front-end) for the deep learning model.

### Instructions

1. Your group should come up with an idea for a Deep Learning application (one that you are personally really excited about) and implement it in Google Colab and integrate it with a web application.
2. Prepare a PowerPoint presentation which includes the following aspects of the project:
    - Project Title, Purpose and Features/Functionalities.
    - Description of the major parts of the Source Code, highlighting important code snippets.

1. Demonstration of the (running) Jupyter Notebook and web app.
2. Upload your PowerPoint file and Project `.zip` file in the PTF Class in MS Teams (`PTF04 – Final Projects`)

### Note

1. Please limit your presentation and demonstration to a max of 10 minutes.
2. Prepare 10 Questions (with Answers) and upload the file (`.pdf`) in the MS Teams class (Files, Class Materials, Finals, Final Projects - Test Bank). Please use the following naming convention for the files: Last Names of team members followed by the Title of Project.
